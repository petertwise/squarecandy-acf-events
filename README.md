# Square Candy ACF Events

A custom events plugin using Advanced Custom Fields

* Requires Advanced Custom Fields Pro 5.x
* Outputs HTML including schema.org structured data
* A basic, easy to use events system

## Settings

* See available settings at **Events > Event Settings**
	* Date formatting options
	* Google Maps API key integration
	* Additional Mapping options
	* Display options

## Shortcodes

**Default:**

Show Upcoming Events in the standard format

`[squarecandy_events]`  
or  
`echo squarecandy_events_func();`

**Archive:**

Show Past Events in the standard format

`[squarecandy_events type=past]`  
or  
`echo squarecandy_events_func( array('type'=>'past') );`

**All:**

Show All Events (past, present and future) in the standard format

`[squarecandy_events type=all]`  
or  
`echo squarecandy_events_func( array('type'=>'all') );`

**Compact:**

Show the compact events block. This is good for sidebars, a homepage block, or other place where a compact preview of upcoming events is needed.

`[squarecandy_events style=compact]`  
or  
`echo squarecandy_events_func( array('style'=>'compact') );`

**Category Filter:**

Filter the list by Event Category. The example below assumes you have already created an event category called "My Example Category" and applied that category to some event items.

`[squarecandy_events cat=my-example-category]`  
or  
`echo squarecandy_events_func( array('cat'=>'my-example-category') );`

**Combinations:**

Combine any of the above as needed...

`[squarecandy_events type=past style=compact cat=my-example-category]`

**Advanced:**

More options are now available:

* `not_in=123,125,127` // filter out specific events by ID
* `posts_per_page=3` // override total posts returned
* `only_featured=true` // filter for featured posts only
* `featured_at_top=true` // order featured posts at top
* `exclude_featured=true` // filter out featured posts
* `more_info_post_link=true` // force the more info button to appear by default & link to the single post instead of to an external website
* `year_sort="ASC"` // sort the past events accordion style years old to new (defaults to new to old)
* `subevent_sort="DESC"` // sort the sub-events of each past year accordion style new to old (defaults to old to new)

## Filters

Available filters:

* `squarecandy_filter_events_fields` - filter the ACF fields array
* `squarecandy_filter_events_supports` - filter the array of components the post type supports ( 'title', 'editor', 'author', 'thumbnail' )

## Roadmap

* add cancelled feature and corresponding schema https://schema.org/EventCancelled
* add online location feature https://schema.org/VirtualLocation https://schema.org/BroadcastEvent
* install Gamajo and make single template overridable
* refactor item previews to use an overridable template file, but don't break shortcodes in the process.
* past events accordions: refactor for less queries
* past events accordions: offer ASC and DESC year sorting
* past events accordions: offer ASC and DESC item sorting within each year
* past events accordions: accessibility fixes for accordion feature
* page-per-year archive: SEO fixes for single year past https://example.com/events/2022/ - add year to title, unique description.
* refactor button icons and labels: make consistent between preview and single; icons always optional; FA6 compatible; etc
* consider a full refactor of external links? replace More Info/Tickets/Facebook fields with a repeater to allow for any amount/kind of external link.
* refactor/rethink: "MORE INFO" button in preview links to single view; "MORE INFO" button in single links to external URL; "MORE INFO" is generic and not accessible.
* accessibility review for entire system
* Check if any clients are using the Google Maps integration anymore. Remove the feature and the code if not.
* Create a v2 css option with a better basic/default look and CSS variables where appropriate.
* Support more preview image positions (left, right, top)
* Improve "add to calendar" to include more than Google.
* make options for both "past" and "all" to be grouped by year independently
* Consider performance limits for all past/archive options (full Past shortcode, Past shortcode with year accordions, page-per-year archives). Implement pagination, AJAX or load-more solutions past reasonable limitations.

**done**
* ~~create hidden takedown/archive date for smoother queries~~
* ~~throw error if end date is before start date~~
