## Shortcodes

**Default:**

Show Upcoming Events in the standard format

`[squarecandy_events]`  
or  
`echo squarecandy_events_func();`

**Archive:**

Show Past Events in the standard format

`[squarecandy_events type=past]`  
or  
`echo squarecandy_events_func( array('type'=>'past') );`

**All:**

Show All Events (past, present and future) in the standard format

`[squarecandy_events type=all]`  
or  
`echo squarecandy_events_func( array('type'=>'all') );`

**Compact:**

Show the compact events block. This is good for sidebars, a homepage block, or other place where a compact preview of upcoming events is needed.

`[squarecandy_events style=compact]`  
or  
`echo squarecandy_events_func( array('style'=>'compact') );`

**Category Filter:**

Filter the list by Event Category. The example below assumes you have already created an event category called "My Example Category" and applied that category to some event items.

`[squarecandy_events cat=my-example-category]`  
or  
`echo squarecandy_events_func( array('cat'=>'my-example-category') );`

**Combinations:**

Combine any of the above as needed...

`[squarecandy_events type=past style=compact cat=my-example-category]`

## Filters

Available filters:

* `squarecandy_filter_events_fields` - filter the ACF fields array
* `squarecandy_filter_events_supports` - filter the array of components the post type supports ( 'title', 'editor', 'author', 'thumbnail' )
